## üìå Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my **QA learning journey**, focusing on **automated testing** for the registration form on [DemoQA](https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form).

The purpose of this project is to practice the implementation of automation tools and good testing practices. Since DemoQA is a demo site for training purposes, no real bugs were found or reported ‚Äî the focus was on simulating realistic scenarios and validating both positive and negative flows.

---

## üéØ Project Goals

- Automate the form filling and submission process.
- Validate required fields and data formats (email, phone).
- Capture screenshots for result analysis.
- Run tests automatically with GitHub Actions (CI/CD).

---

## üîß Technologies and Tools

- **Python**
- **Pytest**
- **Selenium WebDriver**
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/celiapaivab/qa-formulario-selenium-demoqa
  cd qa-formulario-selenium-demoqa
  ```
  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash  
  python -m venv venv  
  source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/macOS)  
  venv\Scripts\activate  (Windows)
  ```
  
3. Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
4. Run the tests with Pytest:
  ```bash
  pytest -s tests/
  ```
- Screenshots will be saved automatically in the screenshots/ folder.

## üßæ Results

- Testes automatizados de fluxo positivo e negativo implementados e executados com sucesso.  
- Valida√ß√£o correta da exibi√ß√£o do modal de confirma√ß√£o apenas em envios v√°lidos.  
- Captura de evid√™ncias visuais por meio de screenshots em casos de sucesso e falha.  
- Pipeline de integra√ß√£o cont√≠nua configurado no GitHub Actions para execu√ß√£o autom√°tica.

---

## üìö What I Learned

- Applied the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern to organize the test code.
- Developed functional automated tests using Selenium and Pytest.
- Implemented screenshot capture and storage for evidence.
- Configured continuous integration with GitHub Actions for automated test execution.

---

## üí° Future Improvements

- Add tests to validate additional form fields.
- Include detailed HTML reports after test execution.
- Expand the test suite to cover other forms and functionalities on the DemoQA site.
- Automate execution on different browsers and screen resolutions for cross-browser testing.
